/*
 * ui_assets -- bounded caches for the Library's pack art: posters, and
 * gameplay stills (the UIStills_ functions at the end, same contract).
 *
 * Serves 192x256 poster content from an offline-generated
 * /swiss/ui/posters.pak (format: docs/PACKS.md).
 * Posters are stored on a 256x256 GX_TF_CMPR canvas with a 5-level mip
 * chain because GX requires power-of-two dimensions for mipmapping; the
 * renderer samples s in [0, UI_ASSETS_CONTENT_W / UI_ASSETS_CANVAS_W].
 *
 * SYNCHRONIZATION CONTRACT (mirrors ui_gameflow: one external critical
 * section, in practice FrameBufferMagic's _videomutex, supplied by the
 * retained-event wrapper as lock/unlock callbacks at Init):
 *
 *   Menu-thread APIs -- Init, RequestWindow, Poll and
 *   CancelForDeviceChange -- must be called WITHOUT the lock
 *   held; they enter the critical section internally for every metadata
 *   mutation and publication. Poll is split so its bounded device read,
 *   CRC, and cache flush run OUTSIDE the lock; only job capture and final
 *   GXTexObj/failure publication run inside it. The lock is never held
 *   across source.read, CRC over a poster, allocation, or free.
 *
 *   Video-thread APIs -- Query, Peek, DominantColor -- are strictly
 *   read-only and must be called WITH the same lock already held by the
 *   caller (the EV_GAMEFLOW render pass owns it); they never lock, so a
 *   non-recursive mutex is safe. Pointers they return (GXTexObj, or
 *   anything derived from the pack index) must not be retained after the
 *   caller releases the lock.
 *
 *   Target Init requires both callbacks. A NULL sync (or an all-zero
 *   callback pair) degrades to no synchronization only in single-threaded
 *   host unit tests; a half-pair is rejected in every build. The exact
 *   lock/unlock/context triple is bound by the first successful Init,
 *   survives CancelForDeviceChange, and cannot change until final disposal.
 *
 * Lifetime rules enforced by that contract:
 *   - The pack index is only freed after it is unpublished inside the
 *     critical section, so no locked reader can ever observe freed memory
 *     (fixes the Query/DominantColor vs CancelForDeviceChange UAF).
 *   - Slot recordPos/generation/state and every GXTexObj are only written
 *     inside the critical section (fixes the RequestWindow/Poll
 *     publication race). The 40 ms eviction quarantine remains a separate
 *     guarantee for GPU texel reuse; the lock protects CPU metadata.
 *   - Handle generations are u32 and increment exactly once per new slot
 *     ownership; a stale handle yields NULL, never a dangling pointer.
 *   - CancelForDeviceChange must run while the video mutex is still live,
 *     before the device is deinitialized. DisposeAfterVideoStop is a
 *     separate lock-free final step after the video thread has joined; it
 *     is safe even if the mutex has already been destroyed.
 *
 * Integration sketch for the persistent EV_GAMEFLOW renderer:
 *
 *   // once, when the retained event is created (menu thread):
 *   uiAssetsSync_t sync;
 *   UIAssets_SyncFromMutex(videoMutex, &sync);  // the _videomutex owner
 *   UIAssets_Init(&source, &sync);
 *   // menu thread, selection moved (WITHOUT the lock):
 *   UIAssets_RequestWindow(ids, count, selectedPos);
 *   // menu thread, once per tick while UIAssets_Poll() returns true:
 *   UIAssets_Poll();
 *   // video thread, per frame per visible card (lock ALREADY HELD):
 *   uiPosterHandle_t h;
 *   switch (UIAssets_Query(id, 6, meta->banner != NULL, &h)) {
 *   case UI_POSTER_EXACT:
 *   case UI_POSTER_UNIVERSAL: {
 *       GXTexObj *tex = UIAssets_Peek(h);   // NULL while still loading
 *       if (tex) drawPosterCard(tex);       // s in [0, 0.75] of the canvas
 *       else drawBnrCard();                 // banner until the poster lands
 *       break; }
 *   case UI_POSTER_USE_BNR:         drawBnrCard(); break;
 *   case UI_POSTER_PROCEDURAL_CARD: drawTintedCard(); break;  // DominantColor
 *   case UI_POSTER_CORRUPT_OR_UNAVAILABLE: drawBnrCard(); break;
 *   }
 *   // before load_game()/device deinit (menu thread):
 *   UIAssets_CancelForDeviceChange();       // every handle now stale
 *   // final teardown, after the video thread has stopped:
 *   UIAssets_DisposeAfterVideoStop();        // lock-free; releases arena
