/*
 * ui_png -- an app's or a folder's picture, from a PNG on the card to a
 * Library poster.
 *
 * Pure: no GX, no I/O, no locks. card_art.c reads the file and hands its
 * bytes here. The result has the poster pack's texture layout (a 256x256
 * GX_TF_CMPR canvas and its four mipmaps, 192x256 of it shown, the right
 * band repeating the last column), so the Library's renderer draws it as
 * it draws a poster.
 *
 * A file from the card is untrusted. Every length and dimension is checked,
 * each chunk's CRC must match, nothing is read past size, the image is
 * decoded a row at a time into a picture a few times the poster's size,
 * and a PNG this can't read is refused whole (false), never shown in part.
 * Interlaced PNGs are refused, and so are a file over UI_PNG_MAX_FILE, at
 * once, and a picture over UI_PNG_MAX_SIDE a side, from its header, before
 * any of its rows are.
 * Whatever the PNG, making its poster never holds more than UI_PNG_MAX_WORK
 * at once (zlib's window included) besides the PNG's bytes and out, and
 * gives all of it back, and it needs little stack (card_art's thread has
 * 32 KB): zlib is never asked for a CRC of more than 8 KB at once.
 * test_ui_png.py counts both.
