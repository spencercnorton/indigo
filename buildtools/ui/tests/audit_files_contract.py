"""The File Browser keeps Swiss's list contract (swiss.c's renderFileList).

Its left pane is the shared listing menu_loop scans, so it does what Swiss's
lists did with it: stops the meta thread before anything acts on a file,
locks an entry while it reads it, keeps current_view_start/end on the left
pane's visible rows whichever pane is focused, reads the visible rows'
banners a row a frame (and the focused entry's before A acts on it) and
never in a draw, and takes the presses a busy moment would lose, but not
those the Source picker had. Its right pane reads its own listing and never touches
what the shared one feeds.

The right pane may hold a storage of its own, mounted outside devices[]. It
lets it go before control leaves the screen and before anything that mounts
or unmounts storage itself (menu_loop's Library and its empty-folder branch,
starting a file, Autoload, Recent, a Source change, either Other devices...,
B), a reset shuts it down, a read that fails mounts it once more, and Swiss's
box on its entries borrows the Source's slot and gives it back. Swiss's box
on either side keeps the other side's storage mounted.

Its Actions run Swiss's own file operations (manage_file_ex) with the
choice made and the other pane's folder as the destination: then Swiss's
destination picker, its mount and its folder chooser never run, and without
a preset they are exactly Swiss's. The landing name is built in one place;
a stopped or failed copy deletes its partial file at each of the four places
it can end early, on the destination only, never a folder of that name nor
anything on a memory card; a stopped Move keeps its original; Replace goes
on only once the file there is gone; a Move that can't take the original
off never runs, and one whose delete fails says so; the copy goes to the
other pane's folder; Delete still needs L held with A; Swiss's questions
keep their words; a result is said once both panes are read again. Every
rule has a mutant that must fail it.
