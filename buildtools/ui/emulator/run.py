"""Boot an Indigo DOL in Dolphin and drive its menus with a controller.

Dolphin (headless: software OpenGL on a virtual X server) boots the DOL with
the demonstration disc (card.py) in the drive. Once Home is up a controller
is plugged in (dsu_pad.py) and a route of button presses walks the cube and
opens each face. Every check compares the screen with itself earlier in the
same run, never with stored pictures, so a redesign does not break the test
while a crash, a hang, a black screen or a broken control does:

  - Home appears after boot, with a face's name under the cube;
  - turning the cube changes the name, five turns come back to the first
    (the disc has apps, so Apps is a fifth face), turning back undoes a
    turn, and the five names differ;
  - A on a face opens another screen, and B comes back to the same face;
  - in the Library, RIGHT and LEFT move between games and back again, and
    A opens a game's details; there UP and A open the game's settings, B
    comes back to the details, and B again to the game;
  - on the Source face, Change Source opens the device picker, RIGHT shows
    another device and B leaves it;
  - on the System face, Memory Cards opens with a memory card in each slot
    (GCI folders of made-up saves, ../qa/make_test_saves.py): RIGHT and LEFT
    move from save to save and across to Slot B and back, DOWN scrolls a
    stack, R and L choose a named storage place and back, A opens the box
    beside a save and B closes it, Copy puts the save on Slot B (its folder
    gains the file, the same blocks), Move is dimmed for it then, Erase
    removes it from Slot A's folder, and B leaves; File Browser opens its
    two panes, RIGHT and LEFT move between them, A opens a folder in either
    and X comes back, Z opens the Actions box and B closes it, R opens the right
    pane's storage menu and a memory card chosen there shows its saves, Y
    swaps the sides and back, L opens the left pane's menu, on the disc a
    device that isn't there says so in its pane, and B leaves;
  - on the Settings face, Setup > Console > Down Face None takes Apps off the
    cube (System's next face is Library), File Browser puts a face of its
    own there (A opens the File Browser, B comes back to that face) and
    Apps puts Apps back;
  - Setup > Console > Cube Classic lays the faces out as the GameCube's menu
    does, Library between them: from Settings, LEFT goes nowhere and RIGHT
    twice is Library, then System; there UP goes nowhere and B is Library;
    UP is Source, DOWN Library, DOWN Apps and UP Library. Cube goes back to
    Infinite after;
  - Setup > Library > Library Folders On shows the disc's folders in the
    Library: an empty folder opens with only its way back, A opens a folder
    and a folder in it, which lists the game a level further down too, and B
    goes back up a folder at a time to the same card, then Home; a folder's
    picture shows as its poster, and a picture too big or damaged never does;
  - on Apps, RIGHT and LEFT move between the disc's apps and back, and A
    starts the probe (probe/probe.c), which reports what the hand-off left
    it: the menu music stopped, nothing still writing to memory, and its own
    path to start from;
  - nothing crashes: Dolphin emulates the MMU, so an invalid memory access
    stops Indigo on its exception screen as it would on a console, and
    Dolphin's own log reports no exception or invalid access.

The game route launches the probe from the Library as a game instead: the
probe must see the game's ID, the full 24 MB and the music stopped.

With --storage sd2sp2 (or sdgecko-b) there is no disc: the release zip is
unpacked onto an SD card image (card.build_card) and Indigo boots from the
zip's own ipl.dol. A new card has no settings yet, so Indigo starts in
Settings and the route saves them first; afterwards it reads back from the
card what Indigo wrote there.

The files route boots from a GC Loader with a second SD card in SD2SP2 and
copies, keeps both, moves, renames, deletes, stops a copy and a move, and
copies into a folder between them, checking each on the card images, and
a game's Detail from there shows its poster; then it boots again with that
SD card failing its writes, and a copy fails. Last, A on the probe's game in
the File Browser opens its Game Detail, B comes back to the same row, and
Detail's Launch Game starts the probe as that game.

The virtual-cards route leaves both physical slots empty, browses a public
synthetic RAW image on SD and exports a GCI into the other SD column. The
actual exported payload and unchanged RAW bytes are checked on the FAT image.
