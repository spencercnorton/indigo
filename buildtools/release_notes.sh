## Install

Follow the **[install guide](https://norvitech.com/indigo/guide/install/)**: pick what starts your GameCube, then four steps. In short: download **\`Indigo-$tag.zip\`** from Assets below (not the Source code ZIP), unzip it on your computer, back up the card's \`swiss\` folder (Swiss hides it) and any \`ipl.dol\` or \`boot.dol\` you replace, then copy two files onto the card.

| What starts your GameCube? | Copy \`ipl.dol\` to | Indigo starts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GC Loader | \`boot.dol\` at the top of the card, keeping \`boot.iso\` (Swiss starts it) | When you switch on |
| PicoBoot or PicoLoader | \`ipl.dol\` at the top of the card, replacing the old one | When you switch on |
| FlippyDrive | \`boot.dol\` at the top of its microSD card | When you switch on |
| Something else, or not sure | \`apps/indigo.dol\` (make \`apps\` if needed) | From Swiss: open \`apps\`, then \`indigo.dol\` |

The second file is \`swiss/patches/apploader.img\`: copy it into the card's \`swiss/patches\` folder (make the folders if needed), replacing the old one, so In-Game Reset set to Apploader returns to Indigo. Any setup can use \`apps/indigo.dol\` and keep starting as it does today. Some PicoBoot and PicoLoader chips have Swiss built in and never read \`ipl.dol\`: the guide shows how to check.

**Updating:** back up the card's \`swiss\` folder, rename the new \`ipl.dol\` to the name of the Indigo file you start now (\`ipl.dol\`, \`boot.dol\` or \`indigo.dol\`) and copy it over that file. Then copy the new \`swiss/patches/apploader.img\` over the old one.

**Posters and cheats** (optional; unzip one and copy the files in its \`swiss/ui\` or \`swiss/cheats\` folder into the card's folder of the same name, making it if needed): [Posters](https://indigo.norvitech.com/indigo-posters-all.zip) (every region, with Spotlight's stills and descriptions) · [Cheats](https://indigo.norvitech.com/indigo-cheats.zip)

**Verify:** \`SHA256SUMS.txt\` lists the zip's SHA-256, and the zip carries a build provenance attestation: \`gh attestation verify Indigo-$tag.zip --repo spencercnorton/indigo\`.
