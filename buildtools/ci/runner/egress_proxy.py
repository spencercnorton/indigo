"""The only way out of a CI job container.

Job containers sit on Docker networks with no route out; this proxy is
attached to those networks and to one that has a route. It opens HTTPS
tunnels (CONNECT host:443) to GitHub and Sigstore and refuses everything
else: other names, other ports, plain HTTP, IP literals, and any name that
resolves to a private, loopback, link-local or otherwise non-public address.
A job can therefore reach GitHub and nothing on the machine's own networks.
