# Library packs

The Library's pictures and descriptions come from optional files in
`/swiss/ui/` on the device you browse:

| File | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `posters.pak` | Box art: a 192×256 front cover per game. |
| `stills.pak` | Gameplay stills: a 320×240 screenshot per game. |
| `descriptions.txt` | A few sentences about each game, for Spotlight. See [below](#game-descriptions). |

Both are built with `buildtools/ui/poster_pack.py` and share one format,
described here. Indigo checks every field below before it uses a pack, and
refuses a pack that differs in any of them.

## Build one

```bash
python3 buildtools/ui/poster_pack.py --covers ~/covers --out posters.pak
python3 buildtools/ui/poster_pack.py --stills ~/screenshots --out stills.pak
```

Name each image after its game ID, such as `GMSE01.png` or `GALE01.jpg`.
Covers are cropped to 3:4 from the center and must be at least 192×256;
screenshots are cropped to 4:3 and must be at least 320×240. Nothing is
scaled up.

For more control, pass `--manifest manifest.json` instead of a folder:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "kind": "stills",
  "records": [
    {"game_id": "GMSE01", "source": "snaps/sunshine.png", "universal": true,
     "source_sha256": "<the file's SHA-256>", "note": "where it came from",
     "focal": [0.5, 0.5]}
  ]
}
```

`kind` is `posters` (the default) or `stills`. Every record needs
`game_id`, `source` (relative to the manifest, or to `--art-root`),
`universal` (below), `source_sha256` and a `note`; `focal` (where to keep
the crop, 0 to 1 across and down, default the center) and `dominant_rgb`
(otherwise the picture's average color) are optional. Any other key is an
error.

The builder needs Pillow and `gxtexconv`, from devkitPro or from the
libogc2 Docker image Indigo's build uses. It works offline and gives the
same bytes for the same inputs. Next to the pack it writes
`<pack>.provenance.json`, which records every picture's source and SHA-256
and the exact converter used.

## Format

Version 1. Every number is big-endian, and every offset is from the start
of the file.

### Header (64 bytes)

| Offset | Size | Field | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0x00 | 4 | magic | `SWPK` |
| 0x04 | 4 | version | 1 |
| 0x08 | 4 | CRC-32 | of the header (with this field as zero), then the index |
| 0x0C | 4 | record count | 1 to 2,048 (Indigo 2.0 and earlier: 1,024) |
| 0x10 | 4 | index offset | 64 |
| 0x14 | 4 | index length | record count × 32 |
| 0x18 | 4 | data offset | 64 + index length |
| 0x1C | 4 | file length | data offset + record count × record size; the file's real size |
| 0x20 | 4 | record size | bytes per texture (below) |
| 0x24 | 2 | canvas width | the texture's width |
| 0x26 | 2 | canvas height | the texture's height |
| 0x28 | 2 | content width | the picture's width inside the canvas |
| 0x2A | 2 | content height | the picture's height inside the canvas |
| 0x2C | 1 | levels | mip levels, the full-size one included |
| 0x2D | 1 | texture format | 14 (`GX_TF_CMPR`) |
| 0x2E | 18 | reserved | zero |

### What each pack declares

| | `posters.pak` | `stills.pak` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Record size | 43,648 | 38,400 |
| Canvas | 256×256 | 320×240 |
| Content | 192×256 | 320×240 |
| Levels | 5 (256 down to 16) | 1 |

A mipmapped GX texture must be a power of two on each side, so a cover sits
on a 256×256 canvas with its last column repeated to the right; Indigo draws
only the left 192 columns. A still is never drawn smaller than it is, so it
has no smaller levels and no padding.

### Index (32 bytes a record, sorted by game ID)

| Offset | Size | Field |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x00 | 6 | game ID: six of `A`–`Z` and `0`–`9` |
| 0x06 | 1 | flags: 0x01 = universal (below); every other bit zero |
| 0x07 | 1 | zero |
| 0x08 | 4 | texture offset: data offset + position × record size |
| 0x0C | 4 | texture length: the record size |
| 0x10 | 4 | CRC-32 of the texture |
| 0x14 | 4 | dominant color: red, green, blue, then 0xFF |
| 0x18 | 2 | focal point x, 0 to 65,535 across the source picture |
| 0x1A | 2 | focal point y |
| 0x1C | 4 | zero |

IDs are strictly increasing: no ID appears twice. The textures follow the
index in the same order, one after another with no gaps.

## Finding a game's picture

Indigo looks up a game's full six-character ID first. If it's not there, a
record flagged **universal** stands for every game whose ID starts with the
same four characters: the game and its region, whatever the publisher code.
At most one universal record may share those four characters.

A texture whose CRC doesn't match is not shown: that game looks as if the
pack had no picture for it, and the rest of the pack still works. The file is read in pieces as the
Library needs them, never all at once: 25 posters and 3 stills at most are
held in memory.

## Game descriptions

`descriptions.txt` is plain text: one game per line, its six-character game
ID, a space (or a tab), then its description, in Windows-1252 as a disc
banner's text is. Lines starting with `#` are comments.

```text
# Descriptions for my card
GMSE01 Clean up Isle Delfino with FLUDD, a water pack with a mind of its own.
GAFE01 Move into a village where something happens every day.
```

The order doesn't matter, and a game's first line wins. A line whose ID isn't
six of `A`–`Z` and `0`–`9` is skipped. The file can be up to 1 MiB and hold up
to 4,096 games. Spotlight shows what fits in six lines of its column, about
250 characters, and ends with "..." when a description runs on.

For a game the file doesn't list, Spotlight uses the first line for another
disc of the same game and region (the same first four characters of its ID),
then its disc banner's own description. Without either, it says the game has
no description rather than leaving the space blank.
