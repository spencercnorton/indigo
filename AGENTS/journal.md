## 2026-10-04 — SD virtual cards and storage selection

Console testing succeeded overall but found an empty SD save view and hard
to discover L/R switching. The explorer now recognizes Swiss RAW images,
validates bounded metadata and streams save blocks for artwork and verified
GCI exports. Images have no write, move, erase or format path. Physical cards
remain available, while absent slots default to independent SD columns.
Permanent L/R storage buttons open named choices instead of cycling blindly.

Regression coverage includes metadata redundancy and malformed chains,
read-only controller routing, independent SD destinations, storage defaults
and a dedicated RAW fuzzer. The coordinated test build also smooths cube
edges and refreshes the affected emulator route and guide.

## 2026-10-04 — Memory Cards cube outlines

Console feedback found jagged outlines around the small save cubes. Their
renderer now adds one native pixel of outward coverage only on silhouette
edges, with shared corners and the same fade as each face. Original fill
quads, save icon texels and banner drawing are unchanged. Both screen shapes,
small and turning cubes, partial fades, GX vertex counts and unchanged icon
geometry have host regressions. The Memory Cards guide pictures need a new
capture from the next combined test build.
