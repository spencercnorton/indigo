## 2026-10-04 — Stabilize Linux MP3 sanitizer startup

The standalone MP3 regression harness now adds `-fno-pie` and `-no-pie`
to sanitizer builds on Linux, matching the host-test Makefile. This avoids
Clang sanitizer failures before `main` on affected Linux hosts while
retaining the address and undefined-behavior checks.

Validation: the plain and sanitized harness passes on macOS; the sanitized
harness passes with GCC and Clang in the pinned Linux build image.
